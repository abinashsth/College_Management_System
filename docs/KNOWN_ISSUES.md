# Known Issues and Limitations

This document outlines the known issues and limitations identified during the Week 18 Testing & Refinement phase of the College Management System. These issues have been categorized by severity and include workarounds where applicable.

## Critical Issues

No critical issues preventing system usage are currently outstanding.

## High Priority

### Performance Issues

1. **Large Dataset Performance**
   - **Issue**: When loading student lists with more than 1000 students, page load times exceed 5 seconds
   - **Status**: Partially fixed with database query optimizations
   - **Workaround**: Use the filtered search to limit the number of displayed records
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement server-side pagination with AJAX loading in Week 19

2. **Report Generation Time**
   - **Issue**: Generating large reports (especially Excel exports) with thousands of records can timeout
   - **Status**: In progress
   - **Workaround**: Use filtered reports for smaller datasets or schedule report generation
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement background processing for large report generation

### Data Integrity

1. **Concurrent Mark Submission**
   - **Issue**: Race conditions can occur when multiple teachers attempt to enter marks for the same student simultaneously
   - **Status**: Fixed with database locking and unique constraints
   - **Verification**: Tested with BugFixingTest.php - test_concurrent_mark_submission_fix()

## Medium Priority

### UI/UX Issues

1. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - **Issue**: Some data tables don't render optimally on small mobile screens
   - **Status**: Partially fixed with responsive design improvements
   - **Workaround**: Use landscape orientation on mobile devices
   - **Planned Fix**: Create dedicated mobile views for complex data tables

2. **Form Validation Feedback**
   - **Issue**: Some form error messages aren't clearly visible to users
   - **Status**: Fixed with enhanced validation feedback
   - **Verification**: Tested with UIRefinementTest.php - test_form_validation_feedback()

### Functional Limitations

1. **Advanced Reporting**
   - **Issue**: Custom report builder has limitations with complex joins and aggregations
   - **Status**: Working as designed, but with limitations
   - **Workaround**: Export data to Excel for advanced data manipulation
   - **Future Enhancement**: Implement advanced reporting engine in a future release

2. **Bulk Operations**
   - **Issue**: Bulk operations (mark entry, student promotion) have limitations with very large datasets
   - **Status**: Improved with chunking implementation
   - **Workaround**: Process data in smaller batches
   - **Verification**: Tested with DatabaseOptimizationTest.php - test_chunk_processing()

## Low Priority

### Browser Compatibility

1. **Internet Explorer Support**
   - **Issue**: Some UI components don't render correctly in Internet Explorer 11
   - **Status**: Won't fix - IE is deprecated
   - **Workaround**: Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

2. **Print Layout**
   - **Issue**: Print layouts for some reports don't match screen layouts exactly
   - **Status**: Minor enhancements made
   - **Workaround**: Use PDF export for consistent printing

### Cosmetic Issues

1. **Form Field Alignment**
   - **Issue**: Some form fields aren't perfectly aligned in certain browsers
   - **Status**: Minor issue, fix scheduled
   - **Impact**: Visual only, no functional impact

2. **Inconsistent Icon Usage**
   - **Issue**: Some sections use different icon styles than others
   - **Status**: In progress
   - **Planned Fix**: Standardize icon usage across the application

## Security Considerations

1. **Session Timeout**
   - **Issue**: Default session timeout might be too long for high-security environments
   - **Status**: Working as designed, configurable
   - **Workaround**: Administrators can adjust session timeout settings in config

2. **SQL Injection Protection**
   - **Issue**: Some custom search functions needed additional input sanitization
   - **Status**: Fixed with proper parameterized queries
   - **Verification**: Tested with BugFixingTest.php - test_sql_injection_fix()

## Performance Optimizations Completed

1. **Eager Loading Implementation**
   - Implemented proper eager loading for related models
   - Reduced database queries by up to 80% in some areas
   - Verification: Tested with DatabaseOptimizationTest.php - test_eager_loading_optimization()

2. **Database Indexing**
   - Added appropriate indexes to frequently queried columns
   - Improved query performance, especially for sorting and filtering
   - Verification: Tested with DatabaseOptimizationTest.php - test_indexing_optimization()

3. **Query Caching**
   - Implemented caching for expensive, frequently-accessed queries
   - Reduced database load for common dashboard statistics

## Accessibility Improvements

1. **ARIA Attributes**
   - Added proper ARIA roles and attributes to improve screen reader compatibility
   - Verification: Tested with UIRefinementTest.php - test_accessibility_improvements()

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Improved keyboard navigation throughout the application
   - Added focus indicators for better keyboard user experience

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Mobile Application**
   - The API structure is prepared for future mobile application development
   - Authentication and data endpoints are designed with API compatibility in mind

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Consider implementing more detailed performance monitoring in production
   - Current testing revealed areas that would benefit from ongoing performance metrics
