# College Management System Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the College Management System, providing guidelines, standards, and best practices for developers working on the project.

## Documentation Files

### [Model Relationships](model_relationships.md)

Comprehensive guidelines for model relationships, covering:

- Naming conventions for relationship methods
- Foreign key naming standards
- Documentation requirements for relationship methods
- How to prevent N+1 query problems
- Academic structure hierarchy relationships
- Common relationship patterns and their implementation

This documentation was created as part of the task to standardize model relationships across the application. It addresses:

- Standardization of relationship methods
- Fixing N+1 query issues
- Implementation of proper eager loading
- Documentation of relationship requirements
- Consistent foreign key naming conventions

## Development Guidelines

All developers working on the College Management System should review these documentation files before making changes to the codebase, especially when working with model relationships.

### Key Implementation Notes

1. Use the `PreventsDuplicateQueries` trait in controllers to standardize eager loading
2. Follow the relationship method naming and documentation standards in all models
3. Ensure proper eager loading in controllers to prevent N+1 query issues
4. Use consistent foreign key naming in migrations and relationship definitions
